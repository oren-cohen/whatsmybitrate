# Whats my Bitrate? - Audio Quality Analyzer

## Overview
This tool analyzes audio files for quality metrics such as bit rate, frequency, and codec type in bulk. It also generates spectrograms for visual representation of the audio spectrum. It supports a variety of audio formats, including MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, M4A, and more.

## Features
- Analyze audio files for detailed quality metrics.
- Generate spectrograms for audio visualization.
- Supports multiple file types: `mp3`, `flac`, `wav`, `aac`, `ogg`, `m4a`, `aiff`.
- Batch processing of files in a directory.
- Recursive directory scanning.
- Multi-threaded processing for faster analysis.
- Export results in HTML or CSV format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- FFmpeg (for metadata extraction and file decoding)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oren-cohen/whatsmybitrate.git
   cd whatsmybitrate
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install FFmpeg:
   - **Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```

     1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
     2. Extract the archive and add the `bin` folder to your system's PATH.

   To verify FFmpeg installation, run:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

## Usage
### Basic Command
Analyze all audio files in the current directory and generate a report:
```bash
python whatsmybitrate.py -f report.html -l -a  # For HTML report
python whatsmybitrate.py -f report.csv -l -a   # For CSV report
```

### Command-Line Arguments
| Argument           | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f <file>`        | Output report file name (required). Use `.html` or `.csv` extension for desired format. |
| `-l`               | Enable logging.                                                                         |
| `-a`               | Analyze all supported audio types.                                                      |
| `-t <type>`        | Analyze a specific file type (e.g., `mp3`, `wav`).                                      |
| `-r`               | Scan directories recursively.                                                           |
| `-m <threads>`     | Number of threads to use for analysis (default: 1).                                     |
| `-n`               | Disable spectrogram generation (spectrograms are generated by default).                 |
| `<input>`          | Specify individual files or patterns (e.g., `*.mp3`, `*.wav`).                          |

### Examples
1. Analyze all files in a directory recursively:
   ```bash
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f analysis.html -l -a -r /path/to/directory  # HTML report
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f analysis.csv -l -a -r /path/to/directory   # CSV report
   ```

2. Analyze only `mp3` files in a directory recursively:
   ```bash
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f mp3_analysis.html -t mp3 -r /path/to/directory  # HTML report
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f mp3_analysis.csv -t mp3 -r /path/to/directory   # CSV report
   ```

3. Analyze specific files:
   ```bash
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f specific_files.html file1.mp3 file2.wav  # HTML report
   python whatsmybitrate.py -f specific_files.csv file1.mp3 file2.wav   # CSV report
   ```

## Supported Audio Formats
- WAV
- FLAC
- MP3
- AAC
- OGG
- M4A
- AIFF

## Output
The script can generate reports in two formats:

- **HTML Report** (use `.html` extension): Contains detailed metrics for each file, including:
  - Codec
  - Sample Rate
  - Max Frequency
  - Nyquist Frequency
  - Frequency Ratio
  - Stated Bit Rate
  - Estimated Bitrate
  - Spectrogram image (if generated)

- **CSV Report** (use `.csv` extension): Contains the same metrics in a tabular format suitable for:
  - Importing into spreadsheet software
  - Data analysis and processing
  - Integration with other tools
  
Note: CSV reports exclude spectrograms as they cannot be represented in CSV format.

## Troubleshooting
### FFmpeg Not Found
Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system's PATH. Test the installation by running:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Missing Spectrograms
If spectrograms are missing:
- Ensure `matplotlib` and `librosa` are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib librosa
  ```
- Check that the audio file is not corrupt or unsupported.

### Errors in Logs
If the script encounters errors, enable logging with the `-l` flag. Review the logs for detailed error messages.
